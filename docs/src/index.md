# PolyaDataStructures

This package provides several datastructures, functions and iterators which may be useful during the design of heuristic solution methods for combinatorial optimization problems.

- custom indexing of a struct through its `indexset`, which enables multilevel indexing
- definition of various standard combinatorial operations
- various structures representing reducing operations, enriched with modifications to speed up their computation when applied to certain combinatorial objects.
